          There are four common patterns:

        <p id="f9cd00d3-1170-4967-b660-c611ce748865" class="">
          The Claim Check pattern is a way to deal with otherwise large
          payloads. These could be as simple as a big document or they could be
          a live streaming video. In both cases, we would be unwise to try and
          put this content into a JSON file and send it to a message broker.
          Data that is large or inherently binary should be handled as a
          reference.

          The JSON or other message will get the metadata, and the reference to
          this large payload. The consumer of the message can reference the
          payload directly to gain access to it at the end point.
        </p>
        <p id="f2232c75-b2bb-40f8-aab7-12bf64e63fc4" class="">
          For security concerns, this can be handled with a secret or key
          transmitted with the message or already known to the consumer to
          securely access the payload.

          Content Enricher
        </h2>
        <p id="6baed724-64b0-46a0-b72c-e0e405bdaf9d" class="">
          The Content Enricher pattern is a way to deal with unnaturally small
          payloads. And example of this is content that contains “magic” IDs or
          other information that expects a high level of context to be
          understood. When exfiltrating this type of content out of its native
          application and publishing to a stream or broker this content gets
          enriched to be more explicite and can be handled by the consumer
          without the high-context expected from is point of origin.

          Message Translator
        </h2>
        <p id="299ba586-2b7b-4f29-ad55-2856ab56e3cd" class="">
          The Message Translator is similar to the Content Enricher, but instead
          of handling the austerity of high-context data is intended to handle
          incompatibilities in data. The easiest example is a legacy system than
          is publishing an data in non-iso compliant formats. The Message
          Translator converts this to the compatible standard expected so that
          the coupling of the contract with the consumer does not have include
          this.

          This can also be seen as an Anti-Corruption layer of the system. It
          can also be part of a Change Data Capture(CDC) process.

        <p id="9b77c4c1-eb4d-4d76-af05-6324c0a88a3e" class="">
          The Outbox pattern is used to overcome design issues where we need to
          support more than one delivery. For instance, a message that needs to
          be entered into a database and submitted to a message broker. We need
          to avoid any cases where the message will succeed in one and fail in
          the other.

        <p id="de477a5c-fad1-4661-8138-4d1be57e686f" class="">
          In this pattern, if we do something like write the message to an
          outbox (think of a table in a database). Once it is there all of the
          operations that need this message happen before it is removed from the
          outbox. (think of some boolean fields for each of the processes) And
          when all of the operations have happened, the message gets removed
          from the outbox. (imagine that a process is watching for this and
          deletes the row when done.)

          This keeps the system integrity of the different processes in sync
          without forcing a dependency on any of them.

          Choosing and using the best pattern for the design and requirements of
          your system will help keep the Event-Driven Architecture moving
          smoothly and increase its maintainability.
