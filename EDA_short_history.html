          We will build one great system. It will do everything. Know about
          everything. And we will build in in Cobol with a two digit year. What
          could go wrong?

          We will build many systems. They will all know about each other all
          the time and talk to each other all the time. Together they will do
          everything and know about everything. And we will make sure they are
          interdependent. What could go wrong?

          We will build a transport bus to handle the communication between our
          systems. They wonâ€™t all have to know about each other. They will do
          special things and only know about what they need to know. They may
          operate asynchronously. Understanding the way these systems work is
          handled by Doug. What could go wrong?

          Orchestrated Integration Architecture

          We will build the transport bus. And all communication can be handled
          asynchronously. Systems will never know about each other. They will
          only send to the Orchestrator(s). The Orchestrators will maintain all
          the business logic of what happens between systems, speaks all of
          their data formats, and can maintain how all of the systems are
          working together at any time.
