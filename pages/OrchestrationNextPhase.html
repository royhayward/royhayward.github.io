      What Does the Future look like?
    </h1>
    <p>
      As organizations scale Single Pane of Glass solutions they need more
      people. They need these people to be awake, alert, attentive, and ready to
      respond when an event of interest happens. Scaling such a workforce is
      expensive and wasteful. Automation is needed to make this viable. Some
      automation can be achieved without changing the architecture.
    </p>

    <p>
      For more powerful automation that lets an organization scale without
      prohibitive costs, an architecture change is needed.

    <h2>
      Automation Requires:
    </h2>
    <ol
      type="1"
      class="numbered-list"
      start="1"
    >
      <li>An open, easy, and non-proprietary message bus.</li>
      <li>An open, easy, and non-proprietary workflow/business logic engine</li>
      <li>
        Ongoing loop of evaluating and adjusting to the data stimulus that the
        system is providing.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Something like this…

      I’ll take this apart into its constituent parts as we go. The first step
      in the process requires communication.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Systems must be able to talk to each other:
    </h2>
    <figure class="image">
      <a href="image/DontSpeakGerman.png">
        <img style="width: 566px" src="image/DontSpeakGerman.png" />
      </a>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Using a common message bus and an orchestrator, each component only has to
      talk to the bus. The Orchestrator is the only one that needs to know
      Spanish vs German, and the other components can be blissfully unaware of
      any of this.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Event-Driven Architecture
    </h2>
    <p>
      What are the events we are talking about in an EDA?
    </p>
    <ul class="bulleted-list">
      <li style="list-style-type: disc">
        <strong>Business event:</strong> Something that
        <strong>happened</strong> in the real business world
      </li>
      <li style="list-style-type: disc">
        <strong>Digital event:</strong> An
        <strong>immutable, time-stamped</strong> digital representation of a
        business event
      </li>
      <li style="list-style-type: disc">
        <strong>Event stream:</strong> An <strong>ordered flow</strong> of
        digital events
      </li>
      <li style="list-style-type: disc">
        <strong>Orchestrated event:</strong> A digital event derived from
        <strong>contextualized event streams analysis</strong>
      </li>
      <li style="list-style-type: disc">
        <strong>Business moment:</strong> A business event that requires a
        &quot;business real-time&quot; <strong>reaction</strong>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Fast digital event capture, propagation and processing
      <strong>empower real-time operations</strong> and
      <strong>situation awareness.</strong>
    </p>
    <h2>
      Understanding the Workflow
    </h2>
    <figure class="image">

      </a>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Events and data flow into the message bus and interact with the business
      logic of the Orchestrator. Commands flow back out from the Orchestrator to
      the security components and to the user’s dashboard.
    </p>
    <ol
      type="1"
      id="2c8aa285-37ed-4289-b292-53123ed99f5b"
      class="numbered-list"
      start="1"
    >
      <li>All actions that can be automated should be.</li>

      <li>
        Users should never be in the middle of a workflow, only at the end or
        the beginning.
      </li>

      <li>
        All data and actions should be saved for audits and used to improve the
        process for future events.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>
      Publishing Events
    </h2>
    <figure class="image">
      <a href="image/input.gif">
        <img style="width: 525px" src="image/input.gif" />
      </a>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Events are published to the Common Message Bus and the Orchestration
      engine subscribes to them and consumes them.
    </p>
    <h2>
      The Orchestration
    </h2>
    <figure class="image">
      <a href="image/bang.gif">
        <img style="width: 1052px" src="image/bang.gif" />
      </a>
    </figure>
    <p>
      The Orchestration engine applies its workflow business logic to the
      incoming messages and sends out commands to the security assets to perform
      the automation.
    </p>
    <figure class="image">
      <a href="image/event.gif">
        <img style="width: 1052px" src="image/event.gif" />
      </a>
    </figure>
    <p>
      The Orchestration Engine also sends messages to the user dashboard.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Applying the ML/AI Loop
    </h2>
      <figure id="ad0f34ef-abe2-4cec-b589-27d1558fd8d7-ML" class="image">
        <a href="image/ML.gif">
          <img style="width: 1052px" src="image/ML.gif" />
        </a>
      </figure>
    <p>
      Data from Red and Green events are gathered and sent to the Machine
      Learning process. From time to time, the ML will produce new workflow
      suggestions and those get sent to update and join the business logic in
      the Orchestration engine.
    </p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      At the end of this process, we have a system driven by events. Automated
      reactions to events and messages happen rapidly and are based on multiple
      sources of data. Users are informed of what is happening and can also
      respond when needed. All of the data from both human actions and automated
      actions are recorded and used to train the next level of automation.

      </a>
    </figure>
    <p>
      The ultimate goal is to combine more data to allow the system to react
      earlier and faster to a Red Action.

    <h2>The ASK</h2>
    <p>
      What I am asking for is a conversation with me. How we can bring our
      security solutions together in a collaborative way to deliver better
      outcomes. And in a way that provides specific data-based insights and
      pushes the zone of detection farther out and earlier.
