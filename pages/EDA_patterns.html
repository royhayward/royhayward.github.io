    <p>
      There are four common patterns:
    </p>
    <ul class="bulleted-list">
      <li style="list-style-type: disc">Claim Check Pattern</li>
      <li style="list-style-type: disc">Content Enricher Pattern</li>
      <li style="list-style-type: disc">Message Translator Pattern</li>
      <li style="list-style-type: disc">Outbox Pattern</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Claim Check</h2>
    <p>
      The Claim Check pattern is a way to deal with otherwise large payloads.
      These could be as simple as a big document or they could be a live
      streaming video. In both cases, we would be unwise to try and put this
      content into a JSON file and send it to a message broker. Data that is
      large or inherently binary should be handled as a reference.
    </p>

      </a>
    </figure>
    <p>
      The JSON or other message will get the metadata, and the reference to this
      large payload. The consumer of the message can reference the payload
      directly to gain access to it at the end point.
    </p>
    <p>
      For security concerns, this can be handled with a secret or key
      transmitted with the message or already known to the consumer to securely
      access the payload.
    </p>
    <h2>Content Enricher</h2>
    <p>
      The Content Enricher pattern is a way to deal with unnaturally small
      payloads. And example of this is content that contains “magic” IDs or
      other information that expects a high level of context to be understood.
      When exfiltrating this type of content out of its native application and
      publishing to a stream or broker this content gets enriched to be more
      explicite and can be handled by the consumer without the high-context
      expected from is point of origin.
    </p>

      </a>
    </figure>
    <h2x>
      Message Translator
    </h2>
    <px>
      The Message Translator is similar to the Content Enricher, but instead of
      handling the austerity of high-context data is intended to handle
      incompatibilities in data. The easiest example is a legacy system than is
      publishing an data in non-iso compliant formats. The Message Translator
      converts this to the compatible standard expected so that the coupling of
      the contract with the consumer does not have include this.
    </p>
    <figure class="image">
      <a href="image/translator_pattern.png">
        <img style="width: 1085px" src="image/translator_pattern.png" />
      </a>
    </figure>
    <p>
      This can also be seen as an Anti-Corruption layer of the system. It can
      also be part of a Change Data Capture(CDC) process.
    </p>
    <h2>Outbox</h2>
    <p>
      The Outbox pattern is used to overcome design issues where we need to
      support more than one delivery. For instance, a message that needs to be
      entered into a database and submitted to a message broker. We need to
      avoid any cases where the message will succeed in one and fail in the
      other.
    </p>
    <figure class="image">
      <a href="image/outbox_pattern.png">
        <img style="width: 886px" src="image/outbox_pattern.png" />
      </a>
    </figure>
    <p>
      In this pattern, if we do something like write the message to an outbox
      (think of a table in a database). Once it is there all of the operations
      that need this message happen before it is removed from the outbox. (think
      of some boolean fields for each of the processes) And when all of the
      operations have happened, the message gets removed from the outbox.
      (imagine that a process is watching for this and deletes the row when
      done.)
    </p>
    <p>
      This keeps the system integrity of the different processes in sync without
      forcing a dependency on any of them.
    </p>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      Choosing and using the best pattern for the design and requirements of
      your system will help keep the Event-Driven Architecture moving smoothly
      and increase its maintainability.
