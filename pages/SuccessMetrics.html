      <h2>Defining the Problem</h2>
      <p>The retail world uses the word “shrink” when they talk about loss-prevention. Shrink is the concept of losing money by way of products not reaching the paying customer. There are a number of ways this can happen. Administrative errors in ordering. Transit issues where product may be lost or stolen. These are areas of shrink. Internal theft by employees or others inside the retail organization is also shrink. </p>
      <p>But when most people think about shrink they are thinking about theft by individuals not part of the organization and not part of the supply chain. This theft breaks down into two categories. Shoplifting and Organized Retail Crime. </p>
      <p>Shoplifting happens when a person posing as a customer leaves the store with a product but without paying. While this can be costly depending on the value of the item and the frequency of the offense it is different from Organized Retail Crime. </p>
      <p>ORC  differs by the scope and sophistication of the theft. When a coordinated an individual or team of individuals work together to steal items from a store we have passed into the sophisticated realm of Organized Retail Crime. When a group of individuals coordinate a theft of the entire inventory of a store we have passed into the scope realm of Organized Retail Crime. </p>
      <h2>Classifying the Types of Shrink</h2>
      <p>If we split shrink into thirds, we have approximately one-third of loss in administrative losses. Order issues, shipping issues, etc. One-third is internal theft from people inside the organization. And one-third is theft from external parties at the retail sales location. These are the shoplifting and ORC thefts. </p>

      </figure>
      <p>Drilling in on the one-third shown in green, half of that shrink is shoplifting and half is ORC. 90% of the shrink in this third is conducted by 10% of the offenders. And often, loss-prevention practitioners know who these individuals are. They are working on tracking them and building a case so they can pursue an arrest and conviction. </p>
      <h2>Measuring Success</h2>
      <p>Deterrence and Prevention are both discussed in Loss-Prevention.</p>
      <h3>Deterrence</h3>
      <p>To deter crime we look to change the offender’s behavior. There are many ways to do this from locks to cameras to security guards. Basically, for these deterrence methods to be effective the subject must see, get, and fear the measures. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>See - the subject must be aware of the deterrent</li>
        <li>Get - the subject must understand what the deterrent does. </li>
        <li>Fear - the subject must feel the deterrent will cause them to be caught.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When they work, a criminal will avoid the location. But they may still move on to commit crimes at another location. This can become like a game of whack-a-mole. But the technical term for this is Crime Displacement.</p>
      <h3>Crime Displacement</h3>
      <p>Criminals are not constrained to a location or a specific type of crime. As the environment changes, they adapt to the new environment. When Big Box Store installs new deterrent measures, the criminal will move to Not So Big Box Store where that deterrent has not been installed. </p>

      </figure>
      <h4>Crime Displacement Factors:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Time - Crime that can be shifted to another time, like when the guard goes to the other side of the building.</li>
        <li>Space - Crime can move to another entrance, part of the store, or to another store across town. </li>
        <li>Type - Prevented from committing theft, the criminal may move to mugging or breaking into vehicles in the parking area.</li>
        <li>Target - Securing the cordless drills in the store doesn’t frustrate the criminal for long, they will shift their target to another product they can resell for cash.</li>
        <li>Methods - Criminals that are prevented from shoplifting as an individual could change their method and instead show up with a team of thieves to overwhelm the deterrence.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Deterrence is still important. </p>
      <h3>Prevention</h3>
      <p>If making an offender fear your store and location moves them to your neighbor, what does preventing crime look like. There are three parts; </p>
      <p>The first part is to take the habitual criminal off the street. Retailers and Loss-Prevention Practitioners can gather enough information to make a compelling criminal case and get a conviction. This sends that criminal to jail and prevents them from committing more crimes for a time.  </p>
      <p>The second part is fear, but a more global fear.  By increasing the effectiveness in charging, convicting, and incarcerating criminals. Specifically, retail criminals, individuals contemplating a life of crime will be disincentivized to enter the retail crime path. This prevents a life of crime.</p>
      <p>The third part is reallocation of resources. When we start taking repeat criminals off of the street, and some of the individuals who would have begun this career are pushed by fear into other careers, the remaining criminals can have more resources focusing on them. With more resources, Loss-Prevention Practitioners can develop cases faster and employ new strategies.</p>
      <h2>Strategies to Reach Success</h2>
      <p>A goal of allowing people to live safer lives is a worthy cause, but it might be hard to measure. But measuring crime and loss from shrink is much easier to measure. So for a metric of success in loss prevention, reducing crime is how we will measure.</p>
      <p>The strategic process is simple. </p>
      <figure class="image">
        <a href="#">
          <img style="width: 100%" src="https://picsum.photos/1500/700" />

      </figure>
      <p>Gathering compelling evidence to prosecute retail criminals, getting them arrested and convicted. Then, at least while they are incarcerated, they won’t be committing retail crime. The diagram above shows this as a loop. This is because the process becomes a recursive path to lower and lower crime rates. </p>
      <p>Once retail crime becomes unattractive because loss-prevention practitioners are more effective at making cases, there will be fewer cases of it. With fewer cases of retail crime, more resources can be focused on the crime that is still happening. And with more resources, we should be able to be even better at making cases and thus getting convictions. </p>
      <h3>Factors in Successful Prosecution:</h3>
      <figure class="image">
        <a href="#">

        </a>
        <figcaption>A random image - high quality images</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <ul>
        <li>Low-enforcement areas</li>
        <li>Low prosecution success rate for retail crime</li>
        <li>Light sentence courts.</li>
        <li>Lack of compelling evidence</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We have the data, we just need the data to become actionable intelligence. Starting at the bottom, employing better communication between the loss-prevention technology that we have can give us an enhanced ability to compile compelling evidence. Too often today, the criminal is identified, but the evidence is not sufficient to get a conviction. </p>
      <p>We can identify areas with judges and prosecutors who are not bringing retail crime cases to court or not sentencing them to adequate terms. When these areas are identified we can file cases where they will have a greater chance of success. Remember that criminals are not constrained to one jurisdiction. This gives loss-prevention practitioners the advantage in choosing the venue to press charges. </p>
      <p>Enforcement is a challenge. It is generally constrained to an area. With efforts in education and the tools of gathering compelling evidence, we may be able to convince these areas to pursue criminals when the case is complete. </p>
