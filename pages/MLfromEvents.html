      It all starts with a question. Without a question, there is nothing for
      the machine to learn. So the first step in our Machine Learning process is
      to synthesize a question. The more specific the question, the better the
      learning will be.
    </p>
    <p>
      In our case, we will use the question of, “Will a theft take place?” This
      is question is specific enough for us to use it as an example. Now that we
      have that out of the way, lets talk about architecture and workflow.
    </p>
    <h2>Architecture</h2>
    <p>
      We need data from as many sources as we can find. So our architecture will
      focus on getting all of this data flowing into a single repository of data
      that can be analyzed. As that data continues to stream across our system,
      a process with a prediction model can monitor it and attempt to find a
      match.

    <ol>
      <li>
        Our Orchestration Application feeds the workflow with all the data
        related to the question
      </li>
      <li>
        The workflow that gets this does any of the CDC or translation of the
        information in this stream of data and records the observations into the
        Observation DB.
      </li>
      <li>
        As new observations are added to the context the Prediction Process will
        fire events at the Orchestration application whenever there is a
        positive prediction or answer to the question.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Orchestration Application will take these predictions and send them
        off as commands to assets or events for other workflows.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      This is a piece of the overall architecture. This is the loop that is
      required for us to make predictions and provide answers to our question,
      “Will a theft take place?”
    </p>
    <h2>Workflow</h2>
    <p>
      In our discussion, a workflow is something that is instigated by the
      Orchestration Application. At the point where it is instigated, it
      consumes an event. This event is then processed according to business
      logic. The workflow can have zero to many outputs of data or events.
    </p>
    <p>
      At zero, the workflow can consume an event and determine that there is
      nothing to do. This might happen if the event is tagged as a test event.
      Or it could be that the workflow knows to ignore the event because of the
      business logic.
    </p>
    <p>
      At one or more outputs, the workflow consumes an event and the business
      logic processes it. The workflow can then take actions to create new
      events for other workflows, store the data, transform the data in the
      event, or many other things. All of this will be based on the business
      logic.
    </p>
    <h2>Learning</h2>
    <p>
      Now we must talk about the process of Machine Learning. Up to this point
      all of this could be created with just a human Business Process Engineer.
      It will start there. There is no reason to ignore human intelligence and
      experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      So for our question, “Will a theft take place?” we start with a simple
      algorithm. We have a list of known shoplifters and put their information
      into the process. Whenever one of them enters the store and the event puts
      that data into the Observation Database, the process fires it’s prediction
      at the Orchestration Application.
    </p>
    <p>But that is not all we want. So we do more.</p>

    <figure class="image">
      <a href="/image/ai_ml_automation.png">
        <img style="width: 100%" src="/image/ai_ml_automation.png" />
      </a>

    </figure>
    <p>
      We add another process to the architecture. This process sees the theft
      events and looks back at the preceding data. It churns on this information
      trying to make a model that will predict the theft correctly over a
      threshold that has been set for accuracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a new model is found, it updates the process making predictions with
      this new algorithm. Now, when this pattern is found in the new
      observations it sends the new prediction to the Orchestration Application.
    </p>
    <h2>Hypothetical</h2>
    <p>
      Our retailer, Big Box, has a list of shoplifters. The staff at the
      entrance has a book of their faces. And they are supposed to be watching
      for them. But this is not completely reliable. So Big Box adds some
      cameras with a Facial Feature matching tool to find them more accurately.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is better, but it only works once the shoplifter has been successful
      the first time. The cameras, people tracking, product tracking, LPR, and
      cell tracker all put data into the Observation Database.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Big Box runs its Machine Learning process against this data the ML
      process identifies a common patterns for thefts. The shoplifters are going
      to the electronics sections of the store and then going to the changing
      rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      This pattern of data is added to the Prediction Process and Big Box can
      now be alerted to a new shoplifter when they fit the pattern. This person
      can then be flagged and watched at the exit and check-out to prevent the
      theft.
    </p>
    <h2>What Data is Getting Used</h2>
    <p>
      There are two classes of events coming in from security sources. Type I
      and Type II. Each class of event gives us something slightly different.
    </p>
    <h3>Type I (No/Low Context Events)</h3>
    <p>
      Type I events contain information that is basic and atomic. This is data
      at a high level. It may be very specific but it does not come with any
      implied or realized higher level of meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      A counter like a turn-style is giving us a count of people. The
      information in these events of entry and exit has no pre-processing or
      urgency attached. We can still act on it. Like a workflow to turn on
      lights when people enter the building, the automation is valuable, but the
      information alone is of limited value.
    </p>
    <h3>Type II (Events with Context)</h3>
    <p>
      Type II events contain information that has been processed and contains
      some level of context. Where an LPR camera can send us Type I events with
      the license plat number. A system that matches against the Hot List of
      vehicles can have additional urgency and context.
    </p>
    <p>
      An event from a system that is doing its own level of threat analysis
      before it triggers an event to the system. Loiter detection, parking in
      the fire lane, or any other higher context activity event give us Type II
      events.
    </p>
    <h3>Type III (Observation Event)</h3>
    <p>
      Yes, there is a third type. This data does not come from a security
      source. This is an event that indicates the bad action has happened. In
      our example, this event is the theft. We add this to our data, so our ML
      process has something to work with as it builds the algorithm to predict
      it. This event is essential to being able to create a predictive process
      to answer the question we are asking.
    </p>
    <h2>Wrap Up</h2>
    <p>
      This example is pretty simple but it illustrates what we are doing and how
      it can help us. ML and AI are not at this time going to have gut feelings
      or be able to look out at a bunch of random data and produce benefits. But
      when we create the question and provide the data, ML and AI can identify
      and make predictions that can help us.
    </p>
    <p>
      By augmenting our human intelligence and pattern recognition with ML and
      AI we can have a broader view of the situation and provide advance warning
      of adverse activities. These are the benefits we are looking for.
