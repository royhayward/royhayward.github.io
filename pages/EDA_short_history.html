    <h2x>The Monolith</h2>
    <px>
      We will build one great system. It will do everything. Know about
      everything. And we will build in in Cobol with a two digit year. What
      could go wrong?
    </p>
    <h2>Peer to Peer</h2>
    <p>
      We will build many systems. They will all know about each other all the
      time and talk to each other all the time. Together they will do everything
      and know about everything. And we will make sure they are interdependent.
      What could go wrong?

    <h2>
      Enterprise Service Bus
    </h2>
    <p>
      We will build a transport bus to handle the communication between our
      systems. They wonâ€™t all have to know about each other. They will do
      special things and only know about what they need to know. They may
      operate asynchronously. Understanding the way these systems work is
      handled by Doug. What could go wrong?
    </p>
    <h2>
      Orchestrated Integration Architecture
    </h2>
    <p>
      We will build the transport bus. And all communication can be handled
      asynchronously. Systems will never know about each other. They will only
      send to the Orchestrator(s). The Orchestrators will maintain all the
      business logic of what happens between systems, speaks all of their data
      formats, and can maintain how all of the systems are working together at
      any time.
