      Imagine if you will, a retail location where five separate domains of
      detectable data were not just gathered together on a single dashboard, but
      those streams of data were gathered together on one automation platform.
    </p>
    <figure class="image">
      <a href="image/fiveDomains.png"
        ><img style="width: 867px" src="image/fiveDomains.png"
      /></a>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Some data would come in directly and others would use a gateway, but all
      the data would stream together. It would still be published to a PSIM or
      dashboard and be visible to the users. But the Event-Driven Architecture
      would implement an Automation and Orchestration workflow logic to
      automatically respond to detected threats.
    </p>
    <p >
      <strong>This would be pretty powerful. </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Now imagine that the data gathered and filtered through a data-governance
      layer is delivered as Machine Learning data to an ML-OPs process. This
      Machine Learning process would suggest and create new algorithms for our
      EDA Automation to act on.
    </p>
    <figure class="image">
      <a href="image/fiveDomainsMachineLearning.png"
        ><img style="width: 894px" src="image/fiveDomainsMachineLearning.png"
      /></a>
    </figure>
    <p>
      The ability to begin to be more predictive in our detections helps us push
      the zone of response farther and farther from the point of impact. We
      could be able to respond to an event before it happens. We might be able
      to alert law enforcement of the probability of a theft. Or to close a
      store when the conditions are right for violence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Honestly, we won’t know what we will be able to see until we start to
      merge the streams of data and build the detection models that our Machine
      Learning tools can give us.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have reached the point where all of these technologies are present and
      we don’t have to build much to make this work. It’s going to be just a
      matter of putting the pieces together, observing what can be seen, and
      then making adjustments until we <strong>make</strong>
      <strong>the world safer. </strong>

    <h1>
      This all starts with…
    </h1>
    <p>
      With a limited number, like five, of IOT devices and services. Organizing
      and simulating the data that they see when they are on a retail site we
      can create the common message bus and event-driven architecture that can
      implement business logic workflow to respond to patterns. We will be able
      to create the first patterns from what we know we see now. Human-created
      automation to automate what can be automated that people have to do now.
    </p>
    <p>
      In no real order, the domains of data include (License Plate Recognition,
      Cell Data Detection, Facial Feature Matching, Asset Tracking/Tagging
      Service, Line of Travel Analytics, and Social Content Scraping) With some
      or all of these domains of data we can be ready for the next phase.
    </p>
    <h1>
      And we have to see how this works.
    </h1>
    <p>
      Piloting the data collection on a real-world retail location may not get
      us enough data to recognize all the patterns. But taking a step to get the
      real data and find what works and what doesn’t is the only way to prove or
      disprove the idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      The plan is to run such an operation for three to six months with the
      specific targets of:
    </p>
    <ul class="bulleted-list">
      <li style="list-style-type: disc">
        Can all the data be gathered onto one common message bus?
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="bulleted-list">
      <li style="list-style-type: disc">
        Can a cloud system be fast enough to issue responses and trigger
        automation?
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="bulleted-list">
      <li style="list-style-type: disc">
        Is an onsite message bus and workflow automation better at triggering
        automation responses?
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="bulleted-list">
      <li style="list-style-type: disc">
        How much data is needed to get ML to produce new algorithms to predict
        theft or violence?
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Results</h1>
    <p>
      After this pilot concludes we will need to evaluate the results and design
      a new project to improve the results and create the pattern for an
      implementable solution for retailers and loss prevention. We will want to
      identify and incorporate new domains of data to add to the process and
      identify domains of data that are redundant.
